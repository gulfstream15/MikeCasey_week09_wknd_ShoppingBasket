# ShoppingBasket
A shopping basket application developed in Java in Android Studio using TDD

This application includes ShoppingBasket, Item and Customer classes to replicate
a s hopping basket. It also has a Shoppable interface that lists methods that 
will add and remove items, empty the basket and determine its value. 
The application was developed from scratch using TDD. It includes a Runner 
to test the output. The application sets the loyalty status for customers 
and sets whether an item is on offer (.e.g 2 for 1). Discounts are applied
for customers that are loyal or have spent over a speficied amount. A runner
class then compares two customer baskets to determine who has spent the most.
